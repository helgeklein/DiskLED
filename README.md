# DiskLED
DiskLED is a small tool that displays Windows performance counter data using an animated system tray icon.

DiskLED comes with a graphical configuration dialog that lets you choose from all performance counters available on the local system â€“ you can monitor network throughput just as easily as hard disk activity or memory usage.
